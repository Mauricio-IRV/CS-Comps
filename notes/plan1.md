#### A short description of the project
- SSL Stripping
- HTTPS spoofing
- DNS spoofing
- IP spoofing
- Man-in-the-middle (different types of attacks)
- Building a command-line tool to implement the attacks
- ettercap and sslstrip (tools for examples)

#### A list of learning goals--what do you want to end up understanding that you don't understand yet?
- Everything
- Network security & vulnerabilities
- Command line tool implementation

#### A list of development goals--what features do you want your software to have by the end of the project? you can label some of items "stretch goals"
- Various network security attack and interception modes (MITM)
- Low-profile (hard to detect, maybe stretch goal)
- Fast and efficient (main goal)
- Cross-platform and diversity of targets

#### A discussion of how you will test (for correctness) and benchmark (for performance) your tool
- Checking return values of attacks against materials hosted on target site
- Percentage of successful attacks against varying levels of security
- Ability to discard non-viable points of attack
- Performance/output compared to existing tools

#### A rough schedule of development--what steps will you take, and what will be your deadlines? (for this, you should be keeping in mind the questions of which pieces of the project can be done in parallel, and how work might be allocated between team members)
- Week 3 - Using existing tools (seeing how each tool works) and narrowing down to two or three attacks. Figuring out best platform and language to write tool in.
- Week 4 - Writing attacks against personally implemented sites
- Weeks 5 to 7 -  Compile attacks in tool
- Week 8 - Testing and benchmarking
- Week 9 - Writing, making a poster, final testing, and presentation rehearsal
